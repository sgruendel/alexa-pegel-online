## TODOs
- Switch to request-promise-native https://github.com/request/request-promise-native
- Water bodies shouldn't be part of slot-LIST_OF_STATIONS.txt, they
get overwritten by create-station-slot-values.js and make
test/list-of-statons.js fail, so better come up with separate
slot-LIST_OF_WATER_BODIES e.g., and they can be autogenerated from
http://www.pegelonline.wsv.de/webservices/rest-api/v2/waters.json
- Add test cases and all water bodies from http://www.pegelonline.wsv.de/webservices/rest-api/v2/waters.json?includeStations=true
- There are two stations named "Frankfurt", they need to be distinguised
- There are two stations named "Neustadt", they need to be distinguised
- There are two stations named "Nienburg", they need to be distinguised
- When asking for a water body, return list of stations, or for "Bodensee" just use "Konstanz"
